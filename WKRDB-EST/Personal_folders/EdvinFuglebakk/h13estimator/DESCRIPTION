Description: Prepeared as part of WKRD-EST 2019. Based on the RDBES datamodel v1.17
 Contains estimators for estimating catch at age in numbers, and it variance, from hiearchy 13 with unequal probability sampling of hauls/fishing operations.
 Contains one example data set of hierarchy 13 sampling with unequal probability, containing 14 sampled hauls.
 The data set was obtained from The pilot of the Norwegian lottery sampling for Herring in 2018.
 The pilot was run for a subset of the fleet which is not identified here.
 Missing samples are not encoded (those are non-response at fishing operation, and readability issues in age determination).
